# BuzzAnalysis
## Overview
Buzz analysis contains code for analysing data from BombusBox rigs.

<br><br>

## Requirements
- python3 (tested in Python 3.8.5)
- numpy
- pandas


python3 should come preinstalled in unix systems but if not, they can be installed with
```
sudo apt-get install python3
```

- pip (or pip3, if native python is not python 3)
- python modules: numpy, pandas

To install numpy and pandas, you will need pip or pip3. To install the requirements:
```
sudo apt install pip3
pip3 install numpy pandas
```

## Running BuzzAnalysis
To run BuzzAnalysis, open up terminal and clone this repository. Then run:

```
cd BuzzAnalysis
python3 ./baseFunctions.py [path to folder holding tracking results] [tests] [whether to analyse data on the left and right separately]
```

As an example, to run the analysis (distance to social center) on the sample data provided:
```
python3 ./baseFunctions.py . distSC True
```

The results of the analysis can then be found in *Analysis.csv* within the BuzzAnalysis folder.

<br><br>

## Adding your own tests
To add your own custom analysis, simply add the relevant code into *baseFunctions.py*. You will then be able to call it from command line. For example:
```
python3 ./baseFunctions.py . distSC customTest False
```
